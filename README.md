This repository contains the data and scripts required to reproduce all of the analyses in the paper entitled "Human disturbance drives microplastic abundance in terrestrial wildlife"

## Notes
* The scripts folder contains all of the R scripts required to run the analyses
* The figures folder contains all figures associated with the work, as well as some supporting figures.
* The data folder contains the blood micropalstics data and the movement summary statistics
